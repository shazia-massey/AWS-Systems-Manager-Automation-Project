# AWS-Systems-Manager-Automation-Project


Systems Manager automation simplifies common maintenance and deployment tasks of Amazon EC2 instances and other AWS resources. The output of the project is that we have an image ID that is an AMI and that is going to be fully patched according to ssm.The important thing of the project is that the automation is fully integrated with cloudwatch events and this will allow us to automate our task and perform some really complex workflows all within a system.
